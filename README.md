# COMP255 Data Engineering

COMP255 - Software Engineering. This assignment aims to implement knowledge in SDLC by developing a human activity recognition IoT application.

## Project Description

This assignment projects makes use of a small number of libraries in Python for the reason of data engineering. 
The main purpose of this assignment is to use SDLC development methods, particularly Agile development methodology, to be able to read numerous data sets, removing any noise and presenting the data in a viewable, user-friendly format.
The data in the data set consists of readings taken by sensors that measure the day-to-day activites of a person. The data given here also compares the activity between multiple different people with differing amounts activities. 


## Getting Started

The code to this assignment is open sourced and to get a copy of the assignment, simply clone the repository and make a pull request on any new features.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Anaconda with Jupyter
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
