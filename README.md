# COMP255 Data Engineering

COMP255 - Software Engineering. This assignment aims to implement knowledge in SDLC by developing a human activity recognition IoT application.

## Project Description

This assignment projects makes use of a small number of libraries in Python for the reason of data engineering. 
The main purpose of this assignment is to use SDLC development methods, particularly Agile development methodology, to be able to read numerous data sets, removing any noise and presenting the data in a viewable, user-friendly format.
The data in the data set consists of readings taken by sensors that measure the day-to-day activites of a person. The data given here also compares the activity between multiple different people with differing amounts activities. 

The Dataset for this assignment has been appropriately named 'Daily Life Activites' or 'DaLiAc' for short.

## Getting Started

The code to this assignment is open sourced and to get a copy of the assignment, simply clone the repository and make a pull request on any new features.

To get the dataset used in the assignment, go to: https://www.mad.tf.fau.de/research/activitynet/daliac-daily-life-activities/
Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the daliac.zip which consists of the dataset based on the activities of a person's daily life activites.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Anaconda with Jupyter
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

# Also dont forget to add these:
```
    Project name: Your project’s name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to your README, and is included upon creation of your README file.

    Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

    Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

    Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

    Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

    Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

    Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

    License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
